        <h1>Overview  Of  Life</h1>
        <p>Since its launch in 1999, loveLife has been obsessed with improving the lives of young people – first through the
            prevention of HIV infection and now including holistic youth development.</p>
        <section class="section">
            <h2 id="first-heading">Vision</h2>
            <p>A leader in Youth Health promotion</p>
        </section>
        <section class="section hidden">
            <h2>Mission statement</h2>
            <img class="float-left" src="about.jpg" alt="about.jpg">
            <p>To promote social activism for healthy living, active lifestyles and HIV consciousness among young people;
            through: –Advocacy –Information, education and awareness campaigns –Healthy living and behavioural change
            interventions –Youth development programmes.</p>
            <p>In its 19 years of existence, the organisation has touched the lives of millions of youngsters – last year alone the organisation’s
            programmes reached 1.8 million people in communities in all nine provinces in South Africa.</p>
            <p>With over 66% of the country’s population being made up of young 7people, we believe that if we address the issues
            facing the youth in a fundamental way we can unleash and unlock tremendous potential that lies within in them.</p>
            <p>We have an amazing, credible platform to speak to the hearts and minds of young people – to power a future through
            the energies of young people. There is a bright future for this country, and it is in the hands of the youth who should,
            whatever the circumstances, never sacrifice their potential on the bedrock of personal or historic disadvantage.</p>
            <p>So loveLife has the potential to really change the experience of the youth in this country –we believe that each young
            person is born with the potential to succeed, to be anything that they want to be provided they have the support and
            encouragement to do so. But social ills including unemployment, gender-based violence, substance and alcohol abuse,
            teenage pregnancy, and HIV infection, among others, continue to place young people at risk. To address through the
            use of its innovative programmatic approaches, loveLife continues with its strategic objectives of:</p>
            <ol>
				<li>Reducing HIV infection among young people;</li>
				<li>Reducing teen pregnancy;</li>
				<li>Keeping young girls in school; and</li>
				<li>Improving employment opportunities for young people.</li>
				<li>To achieve these goals, loveLife has to fundamentally change its way of doing business– the world has changed around
					us and the base of support that in the past was a given, is no longer guaranteed.</li>
			</ol>

            <h2>Gender Based Violence</h2>
            <img class="float-right" src="about1.jpg" alt="about1jpg.">
            <p>loveLife is significantly reliant on government for its funding, but government itself is under significant budgetary
            constraints. A key project for the organisation is changing this weighting from a 90 odd percent reliance on government
            to more of a balance between the private and government sectors.</p>
            <p>The fact that we touch and access 1.5 million young people around the country is a huge opportunity, and we have to
            see how we can use that platform to generate revenue but without over commercialising the organisation.</p>
            <p>9loveLife has a visibility challenge as most people still remember the loveLife as one focused on preventing HIV
            infection through aspirational billboards and the abstinence, be faithful and condomise messaging. It’s not that HIV 
            is no longer a threat. Rather, people know about it but, because of personal circumstances or community issues, find
            themselves at greater risk of HIV infection and at a heightened risk of engaging in substance abuse, having an
            unplanned pregnancy, falling victim to gender-based violence, suicide and crime.</p>

            <img class="float-left" src="lovelife.png" alt="lovelife.png">
            <p>The Department of Basic Education’s figures, show that 1,100,877 learners enrolled for Grade 10 in 2014, but only
            610,178 enrolled for Grade 12 in 2016 – showing an alarming rate of 44.6% of learners either dropping out of the
            system altogether or remaining stuck in Grade 10 and 11.</p>
            <p>South Africa’s unemployment rate has been ranked worst in the world in the latest IMD Global Competitiveness
            Report. For the first quarter of 2016, Stats SA revealed that unemployment was up at 26.7%. And according to the 
            World Economic Forum Global Risk 2014 report, South Africa has the third highest unemployment rate in the world 
            between the ages of 15 and 24 and it estimates that more than 50% of this age group is unemployed.</p>

            <p>So you have a large number of young people who are unskilled, semi-skilled or who have no ability to be productive
                and have no sense of future: That is a big calamity for the country.</p>

            <h2>Helping Hand</h2>
            <img class="float-left" src="lovelife3.jpg" alt="lovelife3.jpg">
            <p>A repositioned loveLife has an important role to play in preventing this calamity. Historically loveLife had a strong
                emphasis on HIV given the prevalence of infection among young people a decade ago. Then, the organisation adopted,
                among others, a preventative strategy, encouraging ABC – Abstinence, Being faithful and Condom usage. And while
                the organisation still aims to reduce the risk of HIV infection among the youth, over the past three years it has evolved
                to address the broader challenges facing young people through holistic youth leadership development.</p>
            <p>Young people are naturally optimistic, energetic and passionate and through holistic development we try to provide a
                platform of expression for these attributes.</p>

            <h2>Schooling</h2>
            <img class="float-left" src="lovelife4.webp" alt="lovelife4.webp">
            <p>Through our myriad of programmes we help young people develop a strong sense of self-awareness, which instils
                confidence in understanding what their strengths are, that they have a right to be here and that they have a contribution
                to make.</p>
            <p>We aim to build resilience so that while they are aware of the challenges and obstacles on the path of success, they 
                recognise that there are also opportunities to develop and challenge the boundaries in the way. We also try to create a
                sense of equality.</p>
